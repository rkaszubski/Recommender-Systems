# Recommender-Systems

Two different recommender projects, both about movies. 

The Amazon recommender using a 5 core dataset from the shopping website. The aim is to provide movie and tv recommendations based on user profiles. This uses the Surprise package in Python.

The Netflix prize recommender is much more extensive. This uses the infamous netflix prize dataset. The aim is to provide again movie recommendations. I have uploaded both the report and the application made for this project. My contribution was creating the Python application. This one does not have an UI but instead uses command line text inputs. Upon launching the appliaciton the user will be asked to rate as many movies as they have seen from the 20 most popular films on the list. Using that information, the application will give you recommendations based on 4 different methods: SVD, clustering, item based classification, and user based classification. Unfortunetly due to the size of the movie dataset, I wasn't able to upload it here. It was already condensed into a .pkl file. In a real world application of this, it would be stored on Netflix's servers.
